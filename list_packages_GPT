i want to do a minimal installation of a linux distribution. Arch linux for example. The base system will be installed and configured. I  have a script which will install basic packages like: sway, firefox, waybar, wofi. I also have the configuration files ready to be installed so these packages work and look like i want to.

I want you to give me an extensive, long, detailed list of things i need to configure or install after i've installed the minimal base plus some basic applications so I'll end up with a fully functional system I can use for gaming, watching video's, install every app on and it will run.
